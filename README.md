# isawake

##### The (eventually) biggest crowdsourced database of when people are awake. Star the project to be updated!

Give your link to update your parents, friends, lovers and collegues about your timezone and sleeping time

Example: [http://nicola.isawake.me](http://nicola.isawake.me)

## Add yourself
Get your `*name*.isawake.me` by adding yourself. At the moment is very geeky, but we will have [user interface](https://github.com/nicolagreco/isawake/issues/9) eventually.

1.  [Create a new file](https://github.com/nicolagreco/isawake/new/master/people) in `people/` calling it yourname.json
2. Add the following information:
```
{
  "offset": -7,
  "range": [8, 24]
}
```

- `offset` is your timezone hours
- `range` is from what time until what time you are awake

3. At the end of the page click on `Commit new file`

## Why this?

When I was at Mozilla (an amazing world-wide distributed company) I wanted to know if the other collegues were awake (so, thanks [@sole](http://github.com/sole), [@jryans](http://github.com/jryans), [@potch](http://github.com/potch))
